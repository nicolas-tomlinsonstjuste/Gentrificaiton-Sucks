                            <p>Dear (Insert Rental Agency/Landlord Name),
                            <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p>Thank you for the opportunity to view your listing, though it met the criteria for what I am looking for, I respectfully decline to pursue this rental on the basis of not wishing to contribute further to gentrification in our neighborhood.
                            <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p>We compared the rental asking price to public data on fair market rent, as determined by HUD, and found it to be above fair market ask. 
                            <br><br>
                            </p>Should you decide to reconsider the rental asking price I would love to discuss negotiations further. 
                                As a member of the community, I believe it is our collective ethical duty to not disrupt and displace communities by forcing them out with inflated and prohibitive housing cost changes.
                            <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p>We urge you to consider your community role and how you will be contributing to the economical impacts of gentrification.
                            <br><br>
                            </p>

                              <p>It is important to me to be a good tenant and have a mutually respectful relationship with the landlord or property management company. 
                                  Long term rental stability and commitment to being a positive impact on my surrounding community are important values of mine. How do you support the housing security and long term stability of your tenants?

                              </p>What are your annual rental increases? Are you open to putting a rental incease cap agreement into our lease?
