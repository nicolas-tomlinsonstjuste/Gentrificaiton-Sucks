# Gentrification-Sucks

By using API keys that cross reference the housing data in the greater Philadelphia area, as well as AQI information, we have created an engaging tool that potential renters can use to gauge the fair market rental costs and air quality data in the area in which they are looking to move relying on the information given from a potential landlord on rent price, the zip code and the number of bedrooms required by the potential tenant.
Our user is coming to the site to determine if the asking price for the rental agreement they are evaluating  is (economically) ethically in line with standing against gentrifying the neighborhood they are looking to rent in.
It could also be used to gauge your personal preferences on whether or not you are paying too much in rent for the neighborhood in which you live
We have achieved our MVP by using a variartion of HUD and AIR NOW API calls, Materialize CSS framework and elements of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery
